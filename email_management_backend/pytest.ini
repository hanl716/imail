    # Test-specific environment variables can be set here if needed.
    # Example:
    # CEREBRAS_API_KEY="test_key_for_pytest_config_ini"
    # DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./test.db" # For integration tests with a test DB
    # FERNET_KEY="..."
    # SECRET_KEY="..."

    # For unit tests, we often mock out external services and env vars.
    # If CEREBRAS_API_KEY is needed for service instantiation before mocking,
    # it could be set here or via monkeypatch in tests.
    # For these tests, we'll use monkeypatch or assume service handles None key.
    # For now, no specific env vars are strictly required by the unit tests as written.
    # Leaving this section empty or with commented examples is fine.
