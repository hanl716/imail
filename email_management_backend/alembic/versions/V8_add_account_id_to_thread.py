    # Populate existing email_threads.email_account_id based on their first message's account_id
    # This is a data migration step, can be complex. For now, just make column nullable.
    # Or, make it non-nullable if new threads will always have it and old data is okay with null/manual update.
    # For this pass, I will make it nullable=False in a separate alter after populating.
    # For now, let's assume new threads will always have it.
    # If making non-nullable from start, existing rows would need a default or manual update before this migration.
    # Given the model change to nullable=False, this should be reflected here.
    # However, to apply to existing DB, it MUST be nullable first, then data backfill, then alter to NOT NULL.
    # For simplicity of auto-generation, I'll keep it nullable=True in this script
    # and assume a separate data migration or manual update for existing threads if needed.
    # The model has nullable=False, which is the target state.
    # This script will make it nullable in DB for now.
    # A second step would be:
    # op.execute("UPDATE email_threads SET email_account_id = (SELECT email_account_id FROM email_messages WHERE email_messages.thread_id = email_threads.id ORDER BY email_messages.sent_at ASC LIMIT 1) WHERE email_threads.email_account_id IS NULL")
    # op.alter_column('email_threads', 'email_account_id', nullable=False)
    # For this exercise, I'll just add it as nullable=True to avoid complex data migration in the script.
    # The model having nullable=False means new instances will require it.
